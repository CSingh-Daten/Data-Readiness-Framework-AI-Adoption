# Telecom Data Readiness Template

This repository provides a step-by-step structure for implementing data readiness for AI/ML use cases in the telecom domain. Use this as a starting point for projects like churn prediction, customer segmentation, or network anomaly detection.

## Structure

- `data/raw/`: Original input datasets (e.g., CDRs, subscriber info)
- `data/processed/`: Cleaned, formatted datasets
- `data/catalog/`: Metadata and data dictionaries
- `scripts/quality_checks/`: Scripts to validate and clean data
- `scripts/feature_engineering/`: Feature generation for AI/ML
- `models/`: Trained models and evaluation metrics
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and validation
- `docs/`: Architecture, compliance, and governance docs
- `.github/workflows/`: CI/CD pipelines for validation and deployment

## Getting Started

1. Place raw data in `data/raw/`
2. Run scripts from `scripts/quality_checks/` to clean and validate
3. Generate features using `scripts/feature_engineering/`
4. Train models in `notebooks/` or `models/`
5. Document all steps in `docs/`

## Sample Use Case

**Customer Churn Prediction**
- Input: 12-month subscriber usage
- Features: Call drops, plan switch rate, complaints
- Output: Monthly churn probability
