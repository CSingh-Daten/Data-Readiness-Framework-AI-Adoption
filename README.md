# Data-Readiness-Framework-AI-Adoption
Below is a step-by-step process to implement Data Readiness for AI/ML using sample telecom data (e.g., customer churn, call records, plan usage). This guide focuses on transforming raw telecom data into AI/ML-ready assets across key readiness dimensions.

📶 Sample Use Case: Customer Churn Prediction
________________________________________
**🔍 Step 1: Define Business & Functional Objectives**
**Goal**: Reduce customer churn by 10% using predictive modeling.
**Business Units Involved**: Marketing, Customer Care, Data Science.
**Task**	                                                  **Tools/Approach**
Identify KPIs (e.g., churn rate, lifetime value)	            Stakeholder interviews
Select target dataset (e.g., 12-month subscriber data)	      SQL, BI tools
________________________________________
**🧹 Step 2: Assess & Improve Data Quality**
**Focus**: Completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness
Task	Tools/Tech	Example
Detect missing values, duplicates	Pandas, PyDeequ, Great Expectations	20% missing “last recharge date”
Standardize formats	Python, Spark	Normalize date formats
Validate logical consistency	Custom scripts	No data where “churn=1” but “active=1”
________________________________________
🏷️ Step 3: Metadata & Cataloging
Goal: Ensure clear definitions and lineage.
Task	Tools	Example
Add schema, definitions	DataHub, Amundsen, AWS Glue Catalog	Define “churn_flag”
Track lineage	OpenMetadata, Atlan	From ingestion to model input
________________________________________
🛡️ Step 4: Ensure Data Governance
Goal: Define ownership, policies, stewardship.
Task	Tools	Notes
Assign data owners	Data Governance Committee	E.g., Customer data → CDO
Define SLA and refresh cycles	Jira, Collibra	Daily pipeline runs
________________________________________
🔐 Step 5: Enforce Data Privacy & Compliance
Goal: Mask, classify, and enforce policies.
Task	Tools	Example
Data classification	AWS Macie, BigID	PII like email, phone
Anonymize or tokenise	AWS DMS, De-identification tools	Mask phone number
Ensure regulatory alignment	GDPR, TRAI (India), CCPA	Add data processing agreements
________________________________________
🏗️ Step 6: Build Data Architecture & Pipelines
Goal: Create scalable ingestion, storage, and processing.
Task	Tools	Example
Data ingestion from telecom OSS/BSS	AWS DMS, Kafka	Daily logs from CDR systems
Store in lakehouse	AWS S3 + Athena or GCP BigLake	Parquet format
Clean & transform	dbt, Spark	Create features for ML
________________________________________
🔄 Step 7: Enable AI/ML Readiness
Goal: Prepare data pipelines, features, and monitoring.
Task	Tools	Example
Feature engineering	Feature Store (SageMaker or Feast)	Avg call drop rate, plan switch count
Model training pipeline	SageMaker, Vertex AI	Train churn model
Monitoring	Evidently AI, WhyLogs	Track drift in churn inputs monthly
________________________________________
🤝 Step 8: Align with Business & Functional Teams
Goal: Close feedback loop and plan for rollout.
Task	Tools	Example
Validate insights with teams	Dashboards (Looker, QuickSight)	Segment churn by geography
Integrate with CRM	APIs, webhooks	Trigger win-back campaign
Track impact	KPI dashboards	Reduction in churn YoY
________________________________________
📊 Final Deliverables:
•	📁 Clean, cataloged AI-ready datasets
•	🧠 Feature store with labeled churn attributes
•	🔍 Data quality and governance dashboards
•	✅ Compliance report (GDPR, CCPA)
•	🤖 Trained churn model integrated with CRM
